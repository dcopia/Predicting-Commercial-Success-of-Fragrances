# FragranceSuccessPrediction
This project was developed as part of the *Digital Transformation Management* course at the University of Bologna.  
The goal is to build a machine learning system capable of **predicting the commercial success of fragrances**, based on their olfactory composition (notes, accords) and market-related features (brand reputation, perfumer expertise, launch year, etc.).
